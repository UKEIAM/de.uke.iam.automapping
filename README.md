Automatic mapping of German medical-related terms into SNOMED-CT.

## Usage
This project utilize Docker for providing an OS-independent development and integration experience. We highly recommend using Visual Studio Code and the associated "Development Container" which allows direct access to a environment and shell with pre-installed Python, corresponding packages, and a specialized IDE experience. However, running Docker standalone is also possible by using the `Dockerfile` in the `devcontainer` folder. **ALL code MUST be runnable within this container!**
